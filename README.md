# Loom

Local development environments without Docker Desktop or hand-written container setup.

Loom creates and runs complete development projects with Podman. Choose a stack,
start it, and work with the source files in your normal editor. Loom handles the
application runtime, databases, startup order, health checks, and local HTTPS.

## What Loom gives you

- Ready-to-use stacks for Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, .NET, databases, and more.
- Project files stored on your computer, where your editor and Git can see them.
- Optional databases configured alongside your application.
- Local HTTPS addresses such as `https://node.loom.local:8443` when a stack provides a route.
- Startup checks that wait until services are actually ready.
- Safer file ownership when containers write into your project.
- Commands for logs, tests, backups, updates, diagnostics, and cleanup.

Loom is designed for local development. It is not a production deployment tool.

## Requirements

- Linux, macOS, or Windows.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 or newer.
- [Podman](https://podman.io/).
- OpenSSL when you use a stack with a local HTTPS route.

On macOS and Windows, Podman uses a small virtual machine. Loom starts that
machine automatically when needed.

## Install

### From npm

```bash
npm install --global @loomdev/cli
```

You can also run Loom without a global install:

```bash
npx @loomdev/cli --help
```

### From a GitHub Release

Linux and macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Loom-development/Loom/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Loom-development/Loom/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

Check the installation:

```bash
loom --version
loom --help
```

## Create your first project

```bash
loom init node --dir my-app
cd my-app
loom start
loom status
```

If Loom asks whether to add a database, choose one or continue without one. When
startup finishes, Loom prints the addresses it prepared. The Node starter normally
uses `https://node.loom.local:8443`.

Loom may ask for permission to add the local hostname. If it cannot, it prints the
entry you can add yourself. Because the HTTPS certificate is created locally, your
browser may ask you to trust it.

When you are done:

```bash
loom stop
```

The first start can take a few minutes because Podman may need to download images
and the project may need to install dependencies. Later starts are usually faster.

New projects default to immutable Loom runtime and database images published at
`ghcr.io/loom-development`. The exact digest is written into `loom.yaml`, so the
same project uses the same image on every machine. Existing projects are not
rewritten automatically. To choose another compatible image, set the matching
`*_IMAGE` value in the project's `.env` file.

## Your files stay local

Loom keeps application source, tests, package files, lockfiles, and environment
files in the project directory on your computer. Containers provide the language
runtime and supporting services, then use your local project directory.

This means you can edit, search, test, and commit the project with your usual tools.
Loom's project records, certificates, and backups are kept under `.loom/`. Database
files and other persistent service data may live under `data/`. Keep these runtime
directories out of application commits; add them to the project's `.gitignore` if
the chosen stack does not already do so.

```gitignore
.loom/
data/
```

## Choose a stack

Run `loom init` without a stack name to choose interactively, or pass one directly:

```bash
loom init python-django --dir my-site
loom init php-wordpress --dir my-blog --db mysql
loom init node-mern --dir my-app
```

### Starter applications

`node`, `bun`, `python`, `php`

### Frameworks and full stacks

`astro`, `django-react`, `dotnet`, `jamstack`, `node-mean`, `node-mern`,
`node-t3`, `php-drupal`, `php-symfony`, `php-wordpress`, `python-django`,
`python-fastapi`, `python-flask`, `rails7`, `rails7-hotwire`, `serverless`,
`spring-boot`, `spring-react`

### Databases

`db-all`, `db-elasticsearch`, `db-mariadb`, `db-mongodb`, `db-mysql`,
`db-postgres`, `db-redis`, `db-sqlite`, `db-sqlserver`

## Add a database

Use `--db` while creating an application. Repeat the option to add more than one:

```bash
loom init node --dir my-app --db postgres
loom init python --dir my-api --db mongodb --db redis
```

Optional database choices are `postgres`, `mysql`, `mariadb`, `mongodb`, and
`redis`. Loom adds the services and connection settings to the generated project.

## Use Loom with an existing project

Go to the project directory and let Loom detect the stack:

```bash
cd my-existing-project
loom adopt
loom start
```

You can provide the stack when detection is not enough:

```bash
loom adopt node
```

Adoption adds Loom configuration without replacing your application source,
package files, lockfiles, or existing environment example.

## Common commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `loom start` | Start the application and its services |
| `loom stop` | Stop this project's services |
| `loom restart` | Stop and start the project |
| `loom start --recreate` | Replace the project's containers and start again |
| `loom status` | Show service and route status |
| `loom ps` | List this project's containers |
| `loom logs app` | Follow logs for the `app` service |
| `loom exec app -- sh` | Open a shell in the `app` service |
| `loom test` | Run the test task defined by the stack |
| `loom doctor` | Check the project and local setup for problems |
| `loom clean --dry-run` | Preview removable dependencies, caches, and builds |
| `loom upgrade` | Update safe files managed by Loom |
| `loom backup <service>` | Back up a database service |
| `loom restore <service> <file>` | Restore a supported database backup |

Run `loom <command> --help` to see all options for a command.

## Safe project updates

Loom records which generated files it owns. `loom upgrade` updates only those
files when they are unchanged or missing. It does not update application source,
package files, lockfiles, `.env`, or other files that belong to you.

```bash
loom upgrade
```

If you edited a Loom-owned file, the command skips it and explains why. Use
`--force-modified` only when you deliberately want to replace those edits.

Projects created by older Loom releases may need a one-time baseline before their
first upgrade:

```bash
loom upgrade --initialize-baseline
loom upgrade
```

## Diagnose problems

```bash
loom doctor
```

Doctor checks the project, Podman, service images, file ownership, ports, routes,
and local host setup. A warning explains something that may need attention; a
failure identifies something that prevents Loom from working correctly.

Useful first checks:

```bash
podman info
loom doctor
loom status
loom logs app
```

If the configuration changed but old containers are still present:

```bash
loom start --recreate
```

## Clean generated files safely

Preview cleanup before removing anything:

```bash
loom clean --dry-run
loom clean
```

Cleanup is limited to dependency, cache, and build paths declared by the chosen
stack. It does not remove application source, `loom.yaml`, `.env`, lockfiles,
Loom's project records, or database data.

## Back up a database

```bash
loom status                   # find the database service name
loom backup postgres          # example: app with PostgreSQL
loom backup db                # example: standalone database stack
loom backup --all
loom restore postgres ./.loom/backups/my-backup.sql
```

Backup supports MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite, and SQL
Server. Restore supports the same databases except SQL Server. Start the database
service before creating or restoring a backup.

## Change a runtime version

Generated projects use tested default image versions. To choose another version,
edit the matching `*_IMAGE` value in the project's `.env` file. Keeping the
choice in `.env` avoids changing `loom.yaml` directly.

## Get help

- Run `loom --help` or `loom <command> --help`.
- Use `loom doctor` inside a project.
- Report bugs or request features in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Loom-development/Loom/issues).
